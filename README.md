# shoove
A lightweight FLOSS application for taking drag-and-drop screenshots

Nicholas - I began shoove as a FLOSS replacement for an application I used on Windows named puush. I used this application for years for its feature to drag-and-drop screenshot with autoupload to a web server. I was disappointed with the amount of bells and whistles added to the available applications on Linux so I decided to write my own.
